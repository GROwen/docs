                            <h2>Overview</h2>

                            <p>The purpose of the NHMRC Centres of Research Excellence (CRE) scheme is to support
                                research that aims to improve health outcomes and promote/or improve translation of
                                research outcomes into policy and/or practice. The CRE scheme will also support
                                researchers in capacity building activities, including in specific areas of need
                                identified by NHMRC.</p>

                            <p>According to the NHMRC scheme-specific guidelines 2015, the specific objectives of the
                                scheme are to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Support the conduct and development of innovative, high quality, collaborative
                                    research
                                </li>
                                <li>Promote effective translation of research into health policy and/or practice;</li>
                                <li>Foster and build capacity in the health and medical research workforce; and</li>
                                <li>Provide opportunities to expand and improve collaborations between research teams.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The Centres of Research Excellence (CRE) scheme will provide support for teams of
                                researchers to pursue collaborative research and develop capacity in clinical,
                                population health and health services research. The second round of Centres of Research
                                Excellence for 2015 (for funding in 2016) will also include two additional streams, each
                                with a particular focus on establishing a collaborative network to achieve scheme
                                objectives.</p>

                            <p> Funding will support five streams:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>CRE in Clinical Research;</li>
                                <li>CRE in Health Services Research;</li>
                                <li>CRE in Population Health Research;</li>
                                <li>CRE in Infectious Disease Emergency Response Research; and</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The intent of the CRE in Infectious Disease Emergency Response Research stream
                                        is to provide support for a single team of researchers to establish a national
                                        research capacity that responds to major infectious disease threats and embeds
                                        research within the health system. This team will develop evidence that can be
                                        implemented in future epidemics, decrease the burden on the health system and
                                        improve health outcomes. Research, training and capacity building will be
                                        focussed on research activities occurring before, during and after infectious
                                        disease emergencies.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                        capacity among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers, facilitate
                                        networks of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders in health research
                                        and/or produce a leadership cohort able to provide training and development
                                        opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research students and
                                        early-career researchers.
