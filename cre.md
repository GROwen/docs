### **Overview**

The purpose of the NHMRC Centres of Research Excellence (CRE) scheme is to support research that aims to improve health outcomes and promote/or improve translation of research outcomes into policy and/or practice. The CRE scheme will also support researchers in capacity building activities, including in specific areas of need identified by NHMRC.

According to the NHMRC scheme-specific guidelines 2015, the specific objectives of the scheme are to:

- Support the conduct and development of innovative, high quality, collaborative research
- Promote effective translation of research into health policy and/or practice;
- Foster and build capacity in the health and medical research workforce; and
- Provide opportunities to expand and improve collaborations between research teams.

The Centres of Research Excellence (CRE) scheme will provide support for teams of researchers to pursue collaborative research and develop capacity in clinical, population health and health services research. The second round of Centres of Research Excellence for 2015 (for funding in 2016) will also include two additional streams, each with a particular focus on establishing a collaborative network to achieve scheme objectives.

Funding will support five streams:

- CRE in Clinical Research;
- CRE in Health Services Research;
- CRE in Population Health Research;
- CRE in Infectious Disease Emergency Response Research; and

-
  - ooThe intent of the CRE in Infectious Disease Emergency Response Research stream is to provide support for a single team of researchers to establish a national research capacity that responds to major infectious disease threats and embeds research within the health system. This team will develop evidence that can be implemented in future epidemics, decrease the burden on the health system and improve health outcomes. Research, training and capacity building will be focussed on research activities occurring before, during and after infectious disease emergencies.

- CRE in Indigenous Researcher Capacity Building.
  - ooThe intent of the CRE in Indigenous Researcher Capacity Building is to build capacity among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers, facilitate networks of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders in health research and/or produce a leadership cohort able to provide training and development opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research students and early-career researchers.
