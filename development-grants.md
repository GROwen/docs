### **Overview**

The Development Grants scheme provides financial support to individual researchers and/or research teams to undertake health and medical research within Australia at the proof of principle or pre-seed stage that specifically drives towards a commercial outcome within a five-year timeframe.

This scheme supports the commercial development of a product, process, procedure or service that if applied, would result in improved health care, disease prevention or provide health cost savings.

Research supported by this scheme must have experimental data that supports a demonstrated proof of principle or pre-seed concept and have a detailed feasible commercialisation strategy that takes into account the regulatory pathway, protectable IP, commercial barriers and potential routes to market.

### **Steps to be completed by Chief Investigator A (CIA):**

1. Submit a Notice of Intent (NOI)

The [NOI](http://noi.mro.unimelb.edu.au/) should be completed early to provide RIC with CIA contact details.
