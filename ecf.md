### **Overview**

The purpose of NHMRC Early Career Fellowships (ECFs) is to provide opportunities for Australian researchers to undertake research that is both of major importance in its field and of benefit to Australian health.

A major objective of the scheme is to foster career development at the postdoctoral level by encouraging the beneficial experience of a different research environment.

ECFs provide for advanced training in health and medical research either in Australia or overseas (where appropriate), to enable Fellows to work on research projects with nominated advisers. Awards are offered to a limited number of persons of outstanding ability who wish to make research a significant component of their career.

Research, Innovation & Commercialisation (RIC) has a [Submission Policy for Major ARC/NHMRC Grants Rounds](http://research.unimelb.edu.au/funding/submission-policy-major-grant-rounds.html). Please review the full policy prior to submitting your application as it applies to this scheme and will be strictly adhered to.
