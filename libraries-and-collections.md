## Libraries and Collections

## University Libraries

The [University of Melbourne Library](http://library.unimelb.edu.au/) operates across multiple branches on the Parkville campus as well as Southbank, Werribee, Creswick and Burnley and collectively the general collections comprise more than 3.5 million volumes (physical and digital). In addition to these collections, it also has custodianship and responsibility for a number of the University Cultural Collections including the University of Melbourne Archives and Grainger Museum. To facilitate access and use of these Collections, the library provides an exceptional range of support services spanning the University's diversity of academic disciplines.

With each library having an intimate involvement with a research discipline, there is tailored support to the academic community around managing information and data, strategy around publishing and sharing, measuring impact, and preserving and archiving research material. More information on these academic support services can be found at the [Researcher@Library](http://library.unimelb.edu.au/research/) website.

## Cultural Collections

There are currently [30 unique collections](http://www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/collections/special/) of historical, cultural and scientific significance within the University of Melbourne, ranging from assortments of rare musical instruments to anatomy museums exhibiting biological specimens of all shapes and sizes with distributed custodianship of each collection across the University.  Research and Collections (Library) support the management of these collections through a central co-ordination point ensuring opportunities to maximise use and access as well as long term care.
