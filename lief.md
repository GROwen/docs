### **Overview**

The Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities (LIEF) scheme provides funding for collaborative research infrastructure of critical mass. Typically involving multiple university partners contributing cash investment, the scale of facility value is between $150,000 and $2,000,000.

Requests for support can be made by researchers in any discipline, with the exception of [Medical and Dental Research](http://www.arc.gov.au/arc-medical-research-policy) which is explicitly not supported through ARC funding.

Proposals involving government research organisations and industry partners are also encouraged.

If you are interested in submitting a LIEF proposal for funding in 2017, please get in contact with [Rachel Ramsdale](mailto:rachel.ramsdale@unimelb.edu.au), Major Initiatives as soon as possible.

### **Funding**

The minimum grant size is $150,000 per year. A project may be awarded funding for one year, or, up to five years for subscription and/or membership costs for coordinated access to major national and/or international facilities or consortia. The ARC will fund up to a maximum of 75 per cent of the direct costs of purchasing the equipment or creating the facility, with collaborating institutions contributing at least 25 per cent. Applications submitted by major universities such as the University of Melbourne would typically involve participant contributions of 35-50 per cent of the direct cost. A Chief Investigator (CI) or Partner Investigator (PI) must not be nominated on more than two LIEF proposals in the same funding round. A CI or PI receiving funding under the LIEF scheme may only be named on a maximum of two concurrent LIEF projects.

All eligible organisations on a Proposal must make a cash contribution.
