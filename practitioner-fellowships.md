## Overview

The Practitioner Fellowships scheme is a key element in NHMRC's commitment to accelerate the bridging of the gap between the acquisition of new knowledge from research and its implementation into practice and policy.

The scheme aims to support research which results in the translation of new evidence into improved clinical practice and health policy and which delivers improvements in health and healthcare to Australians.

The [Changes to the Practitioner Fellowship scheme for 2015](./../../funding/docs/changes_to_practitioner_scheme_for_2015.pdf) document contains important updates to this scheme. Changes to the RGMS sections can be found on the NHMRC [website](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/book/nhmrc-advice-and-instructions-applicants-2015/practitioner-fellowships-scheme-specific-advice-0).

RIC has a [Submission Policy for Major ARC/NHMRC Grants Rounds](./../../funding/submission-policy-major-grant-rounds.html). Please review the full policy prior to submitting your application as it applies to this scheme and will be strictly adhered to.
