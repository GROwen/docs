### **Overview**

The objective of the Project Grants scheme is to support the creation of new knowledge by funding the best investigator-initiated research project plan of five years or less, in any area relevant to human health.

A Project Grant application must outline a research proposal that describes the investigation of a new research idea(s). The proposal must support a particular set of aims and the budget must be directed to those aims. Single investigators or teams of up to 10 Chief Investigators (CIs) are supported as well as New Investigators (early career investigators).

Applicants can choose whether to apply for funding from only one or several organisations that offer funding through the NHMRC Project Grants scheme. Applications for the following funding bodies will be required to complete Supplementary Questions in addition to the standard NHMRC Project Grants application:

- Cancer Council Victoria funds projects between one and three years, providing up to $100,000 per annum
