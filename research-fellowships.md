### **Overview**

The Research Fellowships Scheme aims to recruit and support Australia's very best medical and health research talent in research during the most productive years of their research life. It also helps to further develop them as leaders in their field and contribute to the Australian research community through active participation.

A critical objective of the scheme is to foster an intellectual environment which supports and builds the capacity of Australian research for the future. In so doing, create knowledge through investment in research to improve health and to contribute to Australia's prosperity.

The attached [document](http://research.unimelb.edu.au/funding/docs/Changes-to-Research-Fellowship-Funding-Rules-for-2016.pdf) contains more information about changes to the scheme.

RIC has a [Submission Policy for Major ARC/NHMRC Grants Rounds](http://research.unimelb.edu.au/funding/submission-policy-major-grant-rounds.html). Please review the full policy prior to submitting your application as it applies to this scheme and will be strictly adhered to.
